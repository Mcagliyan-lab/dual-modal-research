# üß† Dual-Modal Neural Network Neuroimaging Framework

## Theoretical Foundation

Our framework adapts neuroscience neuroimaging principles to understand artificial neural networks, providing unprecedented insights into both temporal dynamics and spatial organization.

## Core Components

### NN-EEG: Temporal Dynamics Analysis
**Inspiration**: Electroencephalography (EEG) brain monitoring
**Purpose**: Real-time temporal pattern analysis
**Key Innovation**: Frequency-domain decomposition of layer activations

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Temporal Signal: s_t^(l) = (1/N) Œ£ |a_i,t^(l)|
Power Spectral Density: P(f) = (1/K) Œ£ |F_k(f)|¬≤
State Classification: Based on frequency band powers
```

**Frequency Bands** (adapted from neuroscience):
- Delta (0.5-4 Hz): Deep processing states
- Theta (4-8 Hz): Memory/learning phases
- Alpha (8-13 Hz): Idle/relaxed states  
- Beta (13-30 Hz): Active processing
- Gamma (30-100 Hz): High-level cognition

### NN-fMRI: Spatial Analysis
**Inspiration**: Functional MRI + DTI tractography
**Purpose**: Anatomical mapping of network function
**Key Innovation**: 3D grid partitioning with impact assessment

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Spatial Density: œÜ(g) = mean(|activations|) + Œª¬∑log(variance + Œµ)
Impact Score: Œ∂(g) = E[f(S ‚à™ {g}) - f(S)]
Connection Strength: C = Œ£ |W_ij| ¬∑ ReLU(a_i) ¬∑ œÉ(z_j)
```

**Components**:
- Micro-region partitioning (voxel-like analysis)
- Œ∂-score impact assessment (Shapley-inspired)
- Connection tractography (pathway mapping)

### Cross-Modal Integration
**Purpose**: Validate findings across temporal and spatial domains
**Innovation**: Real-time consistency checking

**Validation Metrics**:
```
Consistency Score = (œÅ_Œ≥Œ∂ + Agreement_state + Coherence_anom) / 3
Cross-correlation: corr(NN-EEG_gamma, NN-fMRI_maxŒ∂)
State Agreement: temporal_errors == spatial_errors
```

## Theoretical Advantages
