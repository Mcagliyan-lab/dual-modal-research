## 4.1 Significance of Findings

### 4.1.1 Validation of Neuroscience-Inspired Approach

Our results provide the first empirical evidence that neuroscience neuroimaging principles can be successfully adapted for neural network interpretability. The NN-EEG component's ability to capture layer-specific frequency signatures demonstrates that temporal dynamics analysis offers genuine insights into network behavior, not merely mathematical artifacts.

**Key Validation Points**:
- **Layer differentiation**: Each layer exhibits distinct frequency signatures
- **Architectural sensitivity**: Convolutional vs linear layers show different patterns
- **Depth effects**: Systematic power attenuation through network depth
- **State recognition**: Correct operational state classification

### 4.1.2 Real-Time Interpretability Paradigm

The successful implementation of real-time temporal analysis represents a significant shift from post-hoc to prospective interpretability. Unlike traditional XAI methods that explain decisions after they're made, our framework enables:

- **Predictive monitoring**: Identify potential issues before they manifest
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Real-time adjustment based on network state
- **Production integration**: Minimal overhead suitable for operational systems
- **Continuous insight**: Ongoing understanding rather than snapshot analysis

## 4.2 Theoretical Implications

### 4.2.1 Information Flow Dynamics

The observed frequency patterns suggest that neural networks exhibit temporal information processing dynamics analogous to biological systems. The systematic power attenuation across layers indicates:

**Information Compression**: Higher layers operate with less "electrical" activity, suggesting information distillation and abstraction processes similar to hierarchical processing in biological brains.

**Frequency Specialization**: Different layers show preferences for different temporal frequencies, potentially indicating specialized processing modes analogous to neural oscillations in biological systems.

### 4.2.2 Bridge Between Neuroscience and AI

Our work establishes a concrete methodological bridge between neuroscience and artificial intelligence:

**Conceptual Mapping**: 
- EEG frequency bands → Network operational states
