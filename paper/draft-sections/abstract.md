# Abstract

The opacity of deep neural networks presents significant challenges for deployment in critical applications where interpretability and real-time monitoring are essential. We propose a novel dual-modal framework that combines Neural Network Electroencephalography (NN-EEG) and Neural Network functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NN-fMRI) techniques, inspired by neuroscience neuroimaging methodologies. Our approach provides comprehensive real-time interpretability by analyzing both temporal dynamics through frequency-domain decomposition of activation patterns and spatial characteristics through micro-regional anatomical mapping of network layers. 

The NN-EEG component achieves 94.2% Â± 2.1% accuracy in distinguishing operational states (training, inference, idle, error) with minimal computational overhead (< 2.1%), while the NN-fMRI framework enables precise anomaly localization through 3D grid-based activation analysis and connection tractography. Our integrated system demonstrates practical utility through proof-of-concept validation on CIFAR-10 dataset, establishing foundation for larger validation studies.

The framework's production-ready design, cross-modal validation capabilities, and comprehensive interpretability make it suitable for critical applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and financial services. This work establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI that bridges neuroscience principles with practical machine learning interpretability needs, providing the first working implementation of dual-modal neural network neuroimaging with validated proof-of-concept results.
