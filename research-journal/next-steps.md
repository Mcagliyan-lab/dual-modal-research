# ‚è≥ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - ACTION PLAN

**Updated**: June 3, 2025
**Priority Level**: üî• URGENT ‚Üí üéØ HIGH ‚Üí üìã MEDIUM

## üî• URGENT (Today - Next 2 Hours)

### 1. Fill Empty Files ‚è∞ ETA: 30 minutes
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
- [x] Identify all empty files (22 files + 3 directories)
- [ ] Create meaningful placeholder content for each
- [ ] Verify no file remains empty
- [ ] Update file inventory

**Action**: Copy provided templates into each empty file

### 2. Update Documentation ‚è∞ ETA: 15 minutes  
**Status**: STARTING
- [ ] Update README.md with current status
- [ ] Create conversation_starter.txt
- [ ] Verify all critical files have content

## üéØ HIGH PRIORITY (Today - Next 4 Hours)

### 3. NN-fMRI Core Implementation ‚è∞ ETA: 2-3 hours
**Status**: READY TO START
**Dependencies**: Empty files filled ‚úÖ

**Implementation Order:**
1. **Spatial Grid Partitioning** (1 hour)
   - 3D grid division algorithm
   - Activation density calculation
   - Grid-wise statistics

2. **Basic Zeta-Score Calculation** (1 hour)
   - Impact assessment framework
   - Lesion simulation
   - Importance ranking

3. **Integration Hooks** (30 minutes)
   - Interface with NN-EEG results
   - Cross-modal validation framework
   - Basic dual-modal reporting

**Success Criteria:**
- Working spatial analysis on CIFAR-10
- Basic zeta-scores calculated
- Integration with NN-EEG functional

### 4. Validation Testing ‚è∞ ETA: 1 hour
**Status**: PLANNED
- [ ] Test NN-fMRI on same CIFAR-10 data as NN-EEG
- [ ] Verify spatial patterns make sense
- [ ] Document initial spatial findings
- [ ] Compare temporal vs spatial insights

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY (This Week)

### 5. Extended Validation (Day 2-3)
- [ ] MNIST dataset validation
- [ ] ResNet architecture testing  
- [ ] Training vs inference state comparison
- [ ] Cross-architecture consistency check

### 6. Documentation Completion (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Write getting-started guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update paper sections with results

### 7. Academic Paper Update (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Add preliminary results section
- [ ] Update methodology with implementation details
- [ ] Revise abstract with "proof-of-concept validation"
- [ ] Prepare submission materials

## üöÄ MOMENTUM MAINTENANCE

**Keep Progress Visible:**
- Update progress.md after each major task
- Document all decisions in decisions-log.md
- Save all results with timestamps
- Maintain conversation continuity

**Avoid Pitfalls:**
- Don't leave any files empty again
- Don't start new features before NN-fMRI complete
- Don't overcomplicate initial implementation
- Don't lose focus on core framework

**Success Formula:**
‚úÖ Working NN-EEG + ‚úÖ Working NN-fMRI + ‚úÖ Clean Integration = üèÜ Complete Framework
